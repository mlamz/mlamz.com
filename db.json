I want start the season at race weight and maintain it throughout. \n\n{% blockquote Dr. Philip Goglia (Phil Gaimon's nutritionist) http://www.velonews.com/2017/01/podcast/fast-talk-ep-10-hit-race-weight-right-way_427913 VeloNews Podcast Ep. 10: Hit Race Weight the Right Way %}\nWhy would you work on losing weight when you’re racing every weekend? The best best time to lose your weight is in base season, which is counter intuitive for most endurance athletes.\n{% endblockquote %}\n\n## Weight Loss Strategies\n\nThere are a number of weight loss strategies: caloric restriction, refining the times of day at which you eat, improving sleep, improving circadian rhythms, decreasing stress, varying macronutrients by metabolic type and reducing the amount of processed foods in the diet.\n\nThe one weight loss strategy that seems to be consistently reliable and repeatable is caloric restriction. For those that are sedentary, the risks seem fairly low with [significant benefits in longevity and metabolic health](http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/78/3/361.full).\n\nAthletes on the other hand need to understand the physiological stresses of caloric restriction and training when done at the same time. \n\n## Effects of Calorie Restriction on Testosterone and Cortisol\n\nTestosterone is an anabolic hormone that helps ensure [low body fat, high muscle mass, good brain function, high red blood cell counts and a high libido](http://www.peaktestosterone.com/Importance_Testosterone.aspx).\nCortisol is a catabolic stress hormone that [prepares the body for a fight-or-flight response](http://www.todaysdietitian.com/newarchives/111609p38.shtml). Chronic high levels of cortisol are linked to [weight gain, cardiovascular disease and depression](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-athletes-way/201301/cortisol-why-the-stress-hormone-is-public-enemy-no-1). It can break muscle tissue, induce visceral fat gain (the fat surrounding your organs) and reduce testosterone levels.\n\nCangemi et al looked at the testosterone levels of men who had been practicing calorie restriction for an average of 7.5 years, and found that they had a [32% drop in testosterone levels](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20096034).\n\nA. Janet Tomiyama et al looked at the levels of cortisol of women restricted to 1200 calories per day and found that [they had increased levels of cortisol](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2895000/).\n\n{% img no-bottom-margin /achieving-and-maintaining-race-weight/cortisol.jpg 720 303 %}*Cortisol levels rose in the calorie restricted group - [Psychosom Med. 2010, Tomiyama AJ et al](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20096034).*\n\nThere is also an assumption that cortisol is bad for you, all of the time.  There is evidence however that acute cortisol spikes which occur after exercise [may actually be beneficial](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22105707).\n\nWill lower levels of testosterone and higher levels of cortisol result in reduced performance? A study by Hoogeveen AR suggests this is perhaps not the case, although I cannot find further studies that either back up or refute their results.\n\n{% blockquote Hoogeveen AR, Zonderland ML. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8884416 Int J Sports Med 1996 - Relationships between testosterone, cortisol and performance in professional cyclists. %}\nThese results suggest that in endurance trained cyclists, decreased testosterone levels, increased cortisol levels and a decreased testosterone: cortisol ratio does not automatically lead to a decrease in performance or a state of overtraining.\n{% endblockquote %}\n\nThe evidence then on whether the testosterone / cortisol ratio is detrimental to performance is inconclusive. From a health perspective however, it seems wise to be cautious with both the degree and the length of time in a caloric deficit. \n\n## Minimizing the Adverse Effects of Caloric Restriction\n\n### Weights, HIIT, Sleep and Decreased Stress\n\nIt appears beneficial to include some [weight training](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00421-006-0319-1) and [high intensity intervals](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23310924) within the training plan, and place sleep quality and decreased stress as a priority to keep [cortisol levels low](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9415946) and [testosterone levels high](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17520786).\n\n### Calorie Shifting\n\nThere is evidence that [calorie shifting](http://suppversity.blogspot.com/2014/11/calorie-shifting-refeeding-for-max-fat.html), in which there is a period of refeeding ad-libitum after a period of caloric restriction, such that you may find in [alternate day intermittent fasting](http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/81/1/69.full), is [more effective than regular controlled calorie restriction for fat loss](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4018593/). \n\n{% blockquote Suppversity http://suppversity.blogspot.com/2014/11/calorie-shifting-refeeding-for-max-fat.html Calorie Shifting (Refeeding) for Max. Fat Loss %}\nThe principle is as simple as effective. You're dieting for 11 days and \"refeeding\", i.e. eat ad-libitum for three days. The intention is to achieve a temporary deficit that's large enough to induce significant weight and fat loss in spite of the potential of temporary over-indulgence on the refeeding days.\n{% endblockquote %}\n\nAnother study showed that the testosterone levels of rats who were underfed and subsequently had a refeeding period, i.e. calorie shifted, had [testosterone levels that rebounded and exceeded the control group](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/21975062_The_influence_of_fed_restriction_and_subsequent_re-feeding_on_gonadotrophin_secretion_and_serum_testosterone_levels_in_male_rats). \n\n### Saturated and Monounsaturated Fats\n\nSaturated fat is extremely calorie dense, and it's often touted by weight watchers as something to avoid to keep calories in check, or [incorrectly blamed for causing heart disease](http://www.marksdailyapple.com/saturated-fat-healthy/). One study shows however that [both saturated and monounsaturated fats significantly increased resting testosterone levels](http://jap.physiology.org/content/82/1/49), and therefore may help offset decreases in testosterone due to calorie restriction.\n\nThe correlation was the inverse however for increasing protein, carbohydrate and polyunsaturated fats. I would have expected a bell shape curve instead of a linear relationship for fat level to testosterone due to the requirements from the body for protein and carbohydrate. The graphs from the study as shown below only show results up to 32.5% of the macronutrient profile as fats however, so I can only hypothesize.\n\n{% img /achieving-and-maintaining-race-weight/saturated-fat-testosterone.jpg 720 834 %}\n\n### Circadian Timing of Food\n\nAs mentioned in my blog post, [Circadian Rhythm Entrainment using Light, Food and Exercise](http://www.mlamz.com/circadian-rhythm-entrainment-using-light-food-and-exercise/), the timing of food is important as well. Keeping the consumption of food to daylight hours with breakfast being the largest meal of the day entrains circadian rhythms which leads to better sleep and therefore lower cortisol and higher testosterone.\n\n{% img /achieving-and-maintaining-race-weight/adelle-davis.jpg 720 339 %}\n\n## How to Achieve or Maintain Race Weight Safely\n\nTaking our research of how to minimize the adverse effects of caloric restriction through weight training, high intensity intervals, calorie shifting, meal timing and sufficient intake of saturated and monounsaturated fats, we can formulate a plan in order to calculate the net calories that should be consumed on a per week to week basis.\n\nFirstly, we need to calculate the net caloric intake for our ideal race weight after training energy expenditure is accounted for.\n\n1. Use a [calorie calculator](http://www.calculator.net/calorie-calculator.html) and put in values for your ideal race weight, not the weight you are currently, and choose the sedentary option.\n1. Multiply this value by seven to get the number of net calories that can be consumed each week.\n1. Count calories for every single bite of food over the week.\n1. Subtract calorie expenditure from exercise each day to get the net calorie value.\n1. Ensure that you are consuming at or less than your weekly net calorie target.\n1. Structure the week to utilize calorie shifting, i.e. refeed days.\n\nUsing myself as an example: My ideal race weight is 141 lbs. The net calories I need to consume is 1,915 calories, and on a weekly basis, 13,405 calories. As I am currently already at my desired race weight, I need to try and not under-eat or over-eat to maintain race weight.\n\nGiven that I typically train 5 days per week, it is easier to have my \"refeed\" days on my non-training days, rather than consume an extremely large amount of food on one or two training days. On a typical Saturday for example, I may expend 2,000 calories, and so having a calorie intake of 3,500 calories to induce a 1,500 net calorie day is realistic. Trying to use a Saturday as a refeed day is not feasible due to the sheer quantity of calories required to do so.\n\nThis is how an example plan for myself then would look like on a week to week basis:\n\n{% img /achieving-and-maintaining-race-weight/plan.png 720 190 %}\n\n## Tools and Practical Tips\n\nI use [MyFitnessPal](http://www.myfitnesspal.com/) to record calories and macronutrient amounts and use a digital scale to weigh food. Estimating calories when eating out is far more difficult as restaurant food has typically higher levels of both sugar and fat than home cooked food. Some restaurants such as Chipotle offer a [nutrition calculator](https://www.chipotle.com/nutrition-calculator).\n\nI use the [TrainingPeaks measurement of caloric expenditure](http://home.trainingpeaks.com/blog/article/how-accurate-is-that-calorie-reading). TrainingPeaks uses the data from my power meter and converts that to a calorie value. I do *not* use the [Strava calorie values](https://support.strava.com/hc/en-us/articles/216917097-Calorie-Calculation) - I find this is always higher than the TrainingPeaks values and they do not seem to provide me with confidence that they have put as much thought into their algorithm as TrainingPeaks have.\n\nHeart rate variability is a metric that I measure every morning to make better training decisions with as it quantifies the physiological stress my body is currently going through. A high or increasing HRV value indicates that my body is recovering well from training with the current caloric intake. A low or decreasing value is a warning that physiological stress is high and I may need to reduce training load or increase caloric intake.\n\n## Putting It Into Practice\n\nThe lowest weight last year that I felt I was climbing well and recovering quickly was in late October at approximately 141 lbs morning weight. I’m currently using this value as my ideal race weight.\n\nIn January, my morning weight was approximately 146 lbs. At the time of writing this blog post, my average morning weight over the past week was 141.8 lbs, so I’m mostly at race weight right now. Using the strategies described above, I lost approximately one pound per week to achieve my race weight, and now I'm looking to maintain this. I have lost weight faster than I planned to, due to finding it difficult to eat enough on [my current regimen of very large breakfasts, large lunches and skipping dinner](http://www.mlamz.com/circadian-rhythm-entrainment-using-light-food-and-exercise/). I'll be looking to adjust to incorporating small dinners into my refeed days, especially as the daylight hours increase.\n\nI have seen many benefits from my changes in eating schedule though - I seem to no longer want to drink coffee at all, my sleep seems to have improved and my alertness during the day seems to be better. I used to always take a melatonin supplement before bed and I now find this is no longer necessary. These benefits should hopefully manifest in a stronger circadian rhythm with a decrease in chronic levels of cortisol and hopefully an increase in testosterone.\n\n## Next Steps\n\nI’m going to try and keep to a daily net intake of 1,915 calories average each week, which should maintain my race weight, but to do so with refeeds on my rest days. This does require discipline, but I seem to be doing this well so far. I'm going to try and increase my intake of saturated fat by eating more butter, coconut oil and red meat.

The best best time to lose your weight is in base season, which is counter intuitive for most endurance athletes.\n{% endblockquote %}\n\n## Weight Loss Strategies\n\nThere are a number of weight loss strategies: caloric restriction, refining the times of day at which you eat, improving sleep, improving circadian rhythms, decreasing stress, varying macronutrients by metabolic type and reducing the amount of processed foods in the diet.\n\nThe one weight loss strategy that seems to be consistently reliable and repeatable is caloric restriction. For those that are sedentary, the risks seem fairly low with [significant benefits in longevity and metabolic health](http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/78/3/361.full).\n\nAthletes on the other hand need to understand the physiological stresses of caloric restriction and training when done at the same time. \n\n## Effects of Calorie Restriction on Testosterone and Cortisol\n\nTestosterone is an anabolic hormone that helps ensure [low body fat, high muscle mass, good brain function, high red blood cell counts and a high libido](http://www.peaktestosterone.com/Importance_Testosterone.aspx).\nCortisol is a catabolic stress hormone that [prepares the body for a fight-or-flight response](http://www.todaysdietitian.com/newarchives/111609p38.shtml). Chronic high levels of cortisol are linked to [weight gain, cardiovascular disease and depression](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-athletes-way/201301/cortisol-why-the-stress-hormone-is-public-enemy-no-1). It can break muscle tissue, induce visceral fat gain (the fat surrounding your organs) and reduce testosterone levels.\n\nCangemi et al looked at the testosterone levels of men who had been practicing calorie restriction for an average of 7.5 years, and found that they had a [32% drop in testosterone levels](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20096034).\n\nA. Janet Tomiyama et al looked at the levels of cortisol of women restricted to 1200 calories per day and found that [they had increased levels of cortisol](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2895000/).\n\n{% img no-bottom-margin /achieving-and-maintaining-race-weight/cortisol.jpg 720 303 %}*Cortisol levels rose in the calorie restricted group - [Psychosom Med. 2010, Tomiyama AJ et al](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20096034).*\n\nThere is also an assumption that cortisol is bad for you, all of the time.  There is evidence however that acute cortisol spikes which occur after exercise [may actually be beneficial](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22105707).\n\nWill lower levels of testosterone and higher levels of cortisol result in reduced performance? A study by Hoogeveen AR suggests this is perhaps not the case, although I cannot find further studies that either back up or refute their results.\n\n{% blockquote Hoogeveen AR, Zonderland ML. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8884416 Int J Sports Med 1996 - Relationships between testosterone, cortisol and performance in professional cyclists. %}\nThese results suggest that in endurance trained cyclists, decreased testosterone levels, increased cortisol levels and a decreased testosterone: cortisol ratio does not automatically lead to a decrease in performance or a state of overtraining.\n{% endblockquote %}\n\nThe evidence then on whether the testosterone / cortisol ratio is detrimental to performance is inconclusive. From a health perspective however, it seems wise to be cautious with both the degree and the length of time in a caloric deficit. \n\n## Minimizing the Adverse Effects of Caloric Restriction\n\n### Weights, HIIT, Sleep and Decreased Stress\n\nIt appears beneficial to include some [weight training](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00421-006-0319-1) and [high intensity intervals](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23310924) within the training plan, and place sleep quality and decreased stress as a priority to keep [cortisol levels low](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9415946) and [testosterone levels high](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17520786).\n\n### Calorie Shifting\n\nThere is evidence that [calorie shifting](http://suppversity.blogspot.com/2014/11/calorie-shifting-refeeding-for-max-fat.html), in which there is a period of refeeding ad-libitum after a period of caloric restriction, such that you may find in [alternate day intermittent fasting](http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/81/1/69.full), is [more effective than regular controlled calorie restriction for fat loss](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4018593/). \n\n{% blockquote Suppversity http://suppversity.blogspot.com/2014/11/calorie-shifting-refeeding-for-max-fat.html Calorie Shifting (Refeeding) for Max. Fat Loss %}\nThe principle is as simple as effective. You're dieting for 11 days and \"refeeding\", i.e. eat ad-libitum for three days. The intention is to achieve a temporary deficit that's large enough to induce significant weight and fat loss in spite of the potential of temporary over-indulgence on the refeeding days.\n{% endblockquote %}\n\nAnother study showed that the testosterone levels of rats who were underfed and subsequently had a refeeding period, i.e. calorie shifted, had [testosterone levels that rebounded and exceeded the control group](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/21975062_The_influence_of_fed_restriction_and_subsequent_re-feeding_on_gonadotrophin_secretion_and_serum_testosterone_levels_in_male_rats). \n\n### Saturated and Monounsaturated Fats\n\nSaturated fat is extremely calorie dense, and it's often touted by weight watchers as something to avoid to keep calories in check, or [incorrectly blamed for causing heart disease](http://www.marksdailyapple.com/saturated-fat-healthy/). One study shows however that [both saturated and monounsaturated fats significantly increased resting testosterone levels](http://jap.physiology.org/content/82/1/49), and therefore may help offset decreases in testosterone due to calorie restriction.\n\nThe correlation was the inverse however for increasing protein, carbohydrate and polyunsaturated fats. I would have expected a bell shape curve instead of a linear relationship for fat level to testosterone due to the requirements from the body for protein and carbohydrate. The graphs from the study as shown below only show results up to 32.5% of the macronutrient profile as fats however, so I can only hypothesize.\n\n{% img /achieving-and-maintaining-race-weight/saturated-fat-testosterone.jpg 720 834 %}\n\n### Circadian Timing of Food\n\nAs mentioned in my blog post, [Circadian Rhythm Entrainment using Light, Food and Exercise](http://www.mlamz.com/circadian-rhythm-entrainment-using-light-food-and-exercise/), the timing of food is important as well. Keeping the consumption of food to daylight hours with breakfast being the largest meal of the day entrains circadian rhythms which leads to better sleep and therefore lower cortisol and higher testosterone.\n\n{% img /achieving-and-maintaining-race-weight/adelle-davis.jpg 720 339 %}\n\n## How to Achieve or Maintain Race Weight Safely\n\nTaking our research of how to minimize the adverse effects of caloric restriction through weight training, high intensity intervals, calorie shifting, meal timing and sufficient intake of saturated and monounsaturated fats, we can formulate a plan in order to calculate the net calories that should be consumed on a per week to week basis.\n\nFirstly, we need to calculate the net caloric intake for our ideal race weight after training energy expenditure is accounted for.\n\n1. Use a [calorie calculator](http://www.calculator.net/calorie-calculator.html) and put in values for your ideal race weight, not the weight you are currently, and choose the sedentary option.\n1. Multiply this value by seven to get the number of net calories that can be consumed each week.\n1. Count calories for every single bite of food over the week.\n1. Subtract calorie expenditure from exercise each day to get the net calorie value.\n1. Ensure that you are consuming at or less than your weekly net calorie target.\n1. Structure the week to utilize calorie shifting, i.e. refeed days.\n\nUsing myself as an example: My ideal race weight is 141 lbs. The net calories I need to consume is 1,915 calories, and on a weekly basis, 13,405 calories. As I am currently already at my desired race weight, I need to try and not under-eat or over-eat to maintain race weight.\n\nGiven that I typically train 5 days per week, it is easier to have my \"refeed\" days on my non-training days, rather than consume an extremely large amount of food on one or two training days. On a typical Saturday for example, I may expend 2,000 calories, and so having a calorie intake of 3,500 calories to induce a 1,500 net calorie day is realistic. Trying to use a Saturday as a refeed day is not feasible due to the sheer quantity of calories required to do so.\n\nThis is how an example plan for myself then would look like on a week to week basis:\n\n{% img /achieving-and-maintaining-race-weight/plan.png 720 190 %}\n\n## Tools and Practical Tips\n\nI use [MyFitnessPal](http://www.myfitnesspal.com/) to record calories and macronutrient amounts and use a digital scale to weigh food. Estimating calories when eating out is far more difficult as restaurant food has typically higher levels of both sugar and fat than home cooked food. Some restaurants such as Chipotle offer a [nutrition calculator](https://www.chipotle.com/nutrition-calculator).\n\nI use the [TrainingPeaks measurement of caloric expenditure](http://home.trainingpeaks.com/blog/article/how-accurate-is-that-calorie-reading). TrainingPeaks uses the data from my power meter and converts that to a calorie value. I do *not* use the [Strava calorie values](https://support.strava.com/hc/en-us/articles/216917097-Calorie-Calculation) - I find this is always higher than the TrainingPeaks values and they do not seem to provide me with confidence that they have put as much thought into their algorithm as TrainingPeaks have.\n\nHeart rate variability is a metric that I measure every morning to make better training decisions with as it quantifies the physiological stress my body is currently going through. A high or increasing HRV value indicates that my body is recovering well from training with the current caloric intake. A low or decreasing value is a warning that physiological stress is high and I may need to reduce training load or increase caloric intake.\n\n## Putting It Into Practice\n\nThe lowest weight last year that I felt I was climbing well and recovering quickly was in late October at approximately 141 lbs morning weight. I’m currently using this value as my ideal race weight.\n\nIn January, my morning weight was approximately 146 lbs. At the time of writing this blog post, my average morning weight over the past week was 141.8 lbs, so I’m mostly at race weight right now. Using the strategies described above, I lost approximately one pound per week to achieve my race weight, and now I'm looking to maintain this. I have lost weight faster than I planned to, due to finding it difficult to eat enough on [my current regimen of very large breakfasts, large lunches and skipping dinner](http://www.mlamz.com/circadian-rhythm-entrainment-using-light-food-and-exercise/). I'll be looking to adjust to incorporating small dinners into my refeed days, especially as the daylight hours increase.\n\nI have seen many benefits from my changes in eating schedule though - I seem to no longer want to drink coffee at all, my sleep seems to have improved and my alertness during the day seems to be better. I used to always take a melatonin supplement before bed and I now find this is no longer necessary. These benefits should hopefully manifest in a stronger circadian rhythm with a decrease in chronic levels of cortisol and hopefully an increase in testosterone.\n\n## Next Steps\n\nI’m going to try and keep to a daily net intake of 1,915 calories average each week, which should maintain my race weight, but to do so with refeeds on my rest days. This does require discipline, but I seem to be doing this well so far. I'm going to try and increase my intake of saturated fat by eating more butter, coconut oil and red meat. I'll be continuing with my timing of food and exercise according to circadian biology.

For those that are sedentary, the risks seem fairly low with <a href=\"http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/78/3/361.full\">significant benefits in longevity and metabolic health</a>.</p>\n<p>Athletes on the other hand need to understand the physiological stresses of caloric restriction and training when done at the same time. </p>\n<h2 id=\"Effects-of-Calorie-Restriction-on-Testosterone-and-Cortisol\"><a href=\"#Effects-of-Calorie-Restriction-on-Testosterone-and-Cortisol\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Effects of Calorie Restriction on Testosterone and Cortisol\"></a>Effects of Calorie Restriction on Testosterone and Cortisol</h2><p>Testosterone is an anabolic hormone that helps ensure <a href=\"http://www.peaktestosterone.com/Importance_Testosterone.aspx\">low body fat, high muscle mass, good brain function, high red blood cell counts and a high libido</a>.<br>Cortisol is a catabolic stress hormone that <a href=\"http://www.todaysdietitian.com/newarchives/111609p38.shtml\">prepares the body for a fight-or-flight response</a>. Chronic high levels of cortisol are linked to <a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-athletes-way/201301/cortisol-why-the-stress-hormone-is-public-enemy-no-1\">weight gain, cardiovascular disease and depression</a>. It can break muscle tissue, induce visceral fat gain (the fat surrounding your organs) and reduce testosterone levels.</p>\n<p>Cangemi et al looked at the testosterone levels of men who had been practicing calorie restriction for an average of 7.5 years, and found that they had a <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20096034\">32% drop in testosterone levels</a>.</p>\n<p>A. Janet Tomiyama et al looked at the levels of cortisol of women restricted to 1200 calories per day and found that <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2895000/\">they had increased levels of cortisol</a>.</p>\n<img src=\"/achieving-and-maintaining-race-weight/cortisol.jpg\" class=\"no-bottom-margin\" width=\"720\" height=\"303\"><em>Cortisol levels rose in the calorie restricted group - <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20096034\">Psychosom Med. 2010, Tomiyama AJ et al</a>.</em><br><br>There is also an assumption that cortisol is bad for you, all of the time.  There is evidence however that acute cortisol spikes which occur after exercise <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22105707\">may actually be beneficial</a>.<br><br>Will lower levels of testosterone and higher levels of cortisol result in reduced performance?

One study shows however that <a href=\"http://jap.physiology.org/content/82/1/49\">both saturated and monounsaturated fats significantly increased resting testosterone levels</a>, and therefore may help offset decreases in testosterone due to calorie restriction.</p>\n<p>The correlation was the inverse however for increasing protein, carbohydrate and polyunsaturated fats. I would have expected a bell shape curve instead of a linear relationship for fat level to testosterone due to the requirements from the body for protein and carbohydrate. The graphs from the study as shown below only show results up to 32.5% of the macronutrient profile as fats however, so I can only hypothesize.</p>\n<img src=\"/achieving-and-maintaining-race-weight/saturated-fat-testosterone.jpg\" width=\"720\" height=\"834\">\n<h3 id=\"Circadian-Timing-of-Food\"><a href=\"#Circadian-Timing-of-Food\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Circadian Timing of Food\"></a>Circadian Timing of Food</h3><p>As mentioned in my blog post, <a href=\"http://www.mlamz.com/circadian-rhythm-entrainment-using-light-food-and-exercise/\">Circadian Rhythm Entrainment using Light, Food and Exercise</a>, the timing of food is important as well. Keeping the consumption of food to daylight hours with breakfast being the largest meal of the day entrains circadian rhythms which leads to better sleep and therefore lower cortisol and higher testosterone.</p>\n<img src=\"/achieving-and-maintaining-race-weight/adelle-davis.jpg\" width=\"720\" height=\"339\">\n<h2 id=\"How-to-Achieve-or-Maintain-Race-Weight-Safely\"><a href=\"#How-to-Achieve-or-Maintain-Race-Weight-Safely\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"How to Achieve or Maintain Race Weight Safely\"></a>How to Achieve or Maintain Race Weight Safely</h2><p>Taking our research of how to minimize the adverse effects of caloric restriction through weight training, high intensity intervals, calorie shifting, meal timing and sufficient intake of saturated and monounsaturated fats, we can formulate a plan in order to calculate the net calories that should be consumed on a per week to week basis.</p>\n<p>Firstly, we need to calculate the net caloric intake for our ideal race weight after training energy expenditure is accounted for.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Use a <a href=\"http://www.calculator.net/calorie-calculator.html\">calorie calculator</a> and put in values for your ideal race weight, not the weight you are currently, and choose the sedentary option.</li>\n<li>Multiply this value by seven to get the number of net calories that can be consumed each week.</li>\n<li>Count calories for every single bite of food over the week.</li>\n<li>Subtract calorie expenditure from exercise each day to get the net calorie value.</li>\n<li>Ensure that you are consuming at or less than your weekly net calorie target.</li>\n<li>Structure the week to utilize calorie shifting, i.e. refeed days.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Using myself as an example: My ideal race weight is 141 lbs. The net calories I need to consume is 1,915 calories, and on a weekly basis, 13,405 calories. As I am currently already at my desired race weight, I need to try and not under-eat or over-eat to maintain race weight.</p>\n<p>Given that I typically train 5 days per week, it is easier to have my “refeed” days on my non-training days, rather than consume an extremely large amount of food on one or two training days. On a typical Saturday for example, I may expend 2,000 calories, and so having a calorie intake of 3,500 calories to induce a 1,500 net calorie day is realistic. Trying to use a Saturday as a refeed day is not feasible due to the sheer quantity of calories required to do so.</p>\n<p>This is how an example plan for myself then would look like on a week to week basis:</p>\n<img src=\"/achieving-and-maintaining-race-weight/plan.png\" width=\"720\" height=\"190\">\n<h2 id=\"Tools-and-Practical-Tips\"><a href=\"#Tools-and-Practical-Tips\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Tools and Practical Tips\"></a>Tools and Practical Tips</h2><p>I use <a href=\"http://www.myfitnesspal.com/\">MyFitnessPal</a> to record calories and macronutrient amounts and use a digital scale to weigh food. Estimating calories when eating out is far more difficult as restaurant food has typically higher levels of both sugar and fat than home cooked food. Some restaurants such as Chipotle offer a <a href=\"https://www.chipotle.com/nutrition-calculator\">nutrition calculator</a>.</p>\n<p>I use the <a href=\"http://home.trainingpeaks.com/blog/article/how-accurate-is-that-calorie-reading\">TrainingPeaks measurement of caloric expenditure</a>. TrainingPeaks uses the data from my power meter and converts that to a calorie value. I do <em>not</em> use the <a href=\"https://support.strava.com/hc/en-us/articles/216917097-Calorie-Calculation\">Strava calorie values</a> - I find this is always higher than the TrainingPeaks values and they do not seem to provide me with confidence that they have put as much thought into their algorithm as TrainingPeaks have.</p>\n<p>Heart rate variability is a metric that I measure every morning to make better training decisions with as it quantifies the physiological stress my body is currently going through. A high or increasing HRV value indicates that my body is recovering well from training with the current caloric intake. A low or decreasing value is a warning that physiological stress is high and I may need to reduce training load or increase caloric intake.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Putting-It-Into-Practice\"><a href=\"#Putting-It-Into-Practice\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Putting It Into Practice\"></a>Putting It Into Practice</h2><p>The lowest weight last year that I felt I was climbing well and recovering quickly was in late October at approximately 141 lbs morning weight. I’m currently using this value as my ideal race weight.</p>\n<p>In January, my morning weight was approximately 146 lbs. At the time of writing this blog post, my average morning weight over the past week was 141.8 lbs, so I’m mostly at race weight right now. Using the strategies described above, I lost approximately one pound per week to achieve my race weight, and now I’m looking to maintain this. I have lost weight faster than I planned to, due to finding it difficult to eat enough on <a href=\"http://www.mlamz.com/circadian-rhythm-entrainment-using-light-food-and-exercise/\">my current regimen of very large breakfasts, large lunches and skipping dinner</a>. I’ll be looking to adjust to incorporating small dinners into my refeed days, especially as the daylight hours increase.</p>\n<p>I have seen many benefits from my changes in eating schedule though - I seem to no longer want to drink coffee at all, my sleep seems to have improved and my alertness during the day seems to be better. I used to always take a melatonin supplement before bed and I now find this is no longer necessary. These benefits should hopefully manifest in a stronger circadian rhythm with a decrease in chronic levels of cortisol and hopefully an increase in testosterone.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Next-Steps\"><a href=\"#Next-Steps\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Next Steps\"></a>Next Steps</h2><p>I’m going to try and keep to a daily net intake of 1,915 calories average each week, which should maintain my race weight, but to do so with refeeds on my rest days. This does require discipline, but I seem to be doing this well so far. I’m going to try and increase my intake of saturated fat by eating more butter, coconut oil and red meat. I’ll be continuing with my timing of food and exercise according to circadian biology. </p>\n"},{"title":"Circadian Rhythm Entrainment using Light, Food and Exercise","date":"2017-02-01T07:00:00.000Z","banner":{"url":"/circadian-rhythm-entrainment-using-light-food-and-exercise/mexico.jpg","width":720,"height":540},"_content":"## Breakfasts and beach sunsets <span> </span>\n\nI've recently come back from a lovely vacation in Mexico.

This is the ability of sunlight to penetrate the skin and induce a *negative electric charge* within the water in our cells and mitochondrial membranes.\n\nI explain what mitochondria are and what they do, and how a negative electric charge in our red blood cells and mitochondrial membranes serves to limit the cumulative damage that is caused by mitochondrial DNA mutations generated by replication errors.\n\nI explain why I believe the ability of mitochondria to regulate the immune system cured a rare disease I used to be afflicted with called cholinergic urticaria. \n\nFurthermore, I explain how melatonin's role in optimizing mitochondrial function, and I explain how a well entrained circadian rhythm through exposure to sunlight during the day and the restriction of artificial light at night ensures sufficient melatonin production.\n\nThere are other benefits that sunlight brings that are outside the scope of this blog post, such as providing the body with a means to create the [sulfated form of vitamin D](http://people.csail.mit.edu/seneff/sulfur_obesity_alzheimers_muscle_wasting.html), which cannot be obtained from a vitamin D supplement, or the ability of sunlight to [improve the cardiovascular system via the production of nitric oxide](https://www.ted.com/talks/richard_weller_could_the_sun_be_good_for_your_heart#t-704130). I hope to expand on these at a later date.\n\n## The Photoelectric Effect of Sunlight\n\nIn 1905, Albert Einstein published a paper that proposed that light acts not as a wave, but as a collection of particles, which we now call [photons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photon). This particle behavior can be observed by the photoelectric effect - the ability of light to displace electrons from a material. \n\nGerald Pollack discovered that [the photoelectric effect occurs when light is absorbed by water](https://ecee.colorado.edu/~ecen5555/SourceMaterial/Pollack13.pdf) in our cells. The chemical structure of the water changes [from H<sub>2</sub>O to H<sub>3</sub>O<sub>2</sub>](http://www.rexresearch.com/pollack/pollack.html), and this body of water [builds next to hydrophillic (water loving) surfaces](http://courses.washington.edu/bioe555/Zheng.pdf), such as those found on cell walls and [mitochondrial membranes](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15749715). Because of this change in chemical structure, the water now has a negative charge that can be utilized, similar to how a battery can store and deliver energy. Gerald Pollack coined the term *“exclusion zone”* or EZ for short, to describe the area of negatively charged water within our cells.\n\n{% blockquote Gerald Pollack, explaining how the EZ builds in mitochondrial membranes https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9UC0chfXcg Tedx Talk - Water, Cells and Life, at minute 9:17. %}\nThose (mitochondrial) membranes are hydrophillic surfaces, and as I mentioned, next to hydrophillic surfaces, EZs build, so this is a perfect configuration for buiding EZs and negative charge.\n{% endblockquote %}\n\n*This negative charge causes the mitochondrial membrane potential to increase, which  improves mitochondrial function. This is explained further in the section on mitochondria.*\n\nThe following diagram from one of Pollack's experiments shows two EZs - the control at the top and the increase in EZ after several minutes of light exposure on the bottom. \n{% img no-bottom-margin /sunlight-and-circadian-rhythms/ez-2.jpg 720 749 %} *Gerald Pollack - [The Fourth Phase Of Water](https://www.amazon.com/Fourth-Phase-Water-Beyond-Liquid/dp/096268953X/ref=mt_hardcover?_encoding=UTF8&me=). Top: control. Bottom: After several minutes of light exposure.*\n\n{% blockquote Gerald Pollack https://ecee.colorado.edu/~ecen5555/SourceMaterial/Pollack13.pdf The Fourth Phase of Water %}\nSo, the arithmetic shows not only that our body bears net negative charge, but also that the body makes every effort to maintain that negativity by ridding itself of protons. It is as though maintaining negativity is a “goal” of life. Plants do it easily: they connect directly to the negatively charged earth; animals need to struggle a bit more to maintain their body’s charge in exchange for greater mobility.\n{% endblockquote %}\n\nPollack also discovered how [the different wavelengths present in sunlight affects the EZ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2843558/). **He discovered that the infrared and ultraviolet wavelengths of light found in sunlight are the most effective at increasing the size of the exclusion zone.** As these wavelengths of light are rarely present in artificial lighting, it is important to ensure that we maximize our exposure to the sun in order to receive both infrared and ultraviolet wavelengths.\n<h2>Mitochondria and Their Utilization of Negative Charge</h2>Mitochondria are organelles that exist in large numbers within our cells. Mitochondria have their own DNA, independent of the nuclear genome within their parent cell. Their main function is to convert electrons obtained from food into ATP, the energy currency of our cells. This conversion process is called oxidative phosphorylation, and it has an oxidative effect which can damage the mitochondria DNA. Mitochondria also [signals apoptosis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4762029/) (cell death) to its parent cell, such that when it detects mitochondrial DNA damage within itself, it asks its parent cell to commit suicide. If this signaling process fails, [then faulty mitochondria can replicate and lead to cancer, other diseases and aging](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3675642/).\n\nMitochondria can also directly capture electrons directly from sunlight [through light absorbed by chlorophyll pigments](http://jcs.biologists.org/content/127/2/388). These captured electrons [increase the mitochondrial membrane potential](Light-harvesting chlorophyll pigments enable mammalian mitochondria to capture photonic energy and produce ATP), i.e. the amount of negative charge stored within the mitochondrial membrane.\n<h3>The Mitochondrial Membrane Potential</h3>This negative charge in the EZ water is used in multiple functions in the body, such as to drive blood through capillaries and to [increase the mitochondrial membrane potential](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3115691/), which optimizes mitochondrial function, such as to [ensure efficient ATP production](http://www.biotechniques.com/BiotechniquesJournal/2011/February/Mitochondrial-membrane-potential-probes-and-the-proton-gradient-a-practical-usage-guide/biotechniques-308950.html), or to ensure proper signaling to the parent cells and immune system. The lower the negative charge, the [higher the possibility that the apoptosis signal from the mitochondria will be ignored by the cell](http://www.jbc.org/content/275/10/7087.full). If the apoptosis signal is ignored, damaged cells and their mitochondria will replicate.\n\nJack Kruse calls the amount of negative charge stored within our cells the redox potential.\n{% blockquote Jack Kruse https://www.jackkruse.com/organizational-structural-failure-6-mitochondrial-rx/ The Mitochondrial Rx %}\nThe redox levels in mitochondrion are like a scale of justice.  When protons are more prominent, the redox potential is poor.  When we have more electrons in the system, the redox potential is excellent.  The more electrons we have, the more potential and kinetic energy is stored in our proteins and water hydration shell to allow us to deal with the stressors of the environment.  The human species is designed to collect electrons in excess.  Think of the redox potential as a giant sink of electrons and protons.  We need more negatively charged electrons to run our mitochondria and proteins well.  This is our redox sink or bank account.\n{% endblockquote %}<h4>The more negative charge we can obtain then, the better. More sunlight means more negative charge, which leads to better mitochondrial health and signaling.</h4><h3>The Mitochondria's Role In Regulating the Immune System</h3>[Recent research](http://www.cell.com/immunity/fulltext/S1074-7613%2815%2900077-1) has shown that mitochondria are critical to activation of the immune system response, as well as [the important role of mitochondria in mast cell activation](http://search.proquest.com/docview/861922036).\n\nOn a personal note, I suffered from cholinergic urticaria for a number of years. [Cholinergic urticaria is a disease of the immune system](http://www.webmd.com/allergies/urticaria-cholinergic), and more specifically, it is caused by the **[inability to activate mast cells in the skin prior to sweat release](http://www.cholinergicurticaria.net/).**\n\nThe symptoms of cholinergic urticaria were painful - it felt as if my body was on fire. It was triggered suddenly by any change to stress levels, heat or exercise. The cure for my condition came in the form of increased sun exposure and UVB phototherapy at a hospital multiple times per week.<h4>The effect of sunlight on optimizing mitochondrial function, and the subsequent role of the mitochondria in immune system regulation of mast cells is the reason why I believe that UVB phototherapy and sun exposure cured my condition.</h4><h3>The Mitochondrial Theory of Aging</h3>Rodney Shackelford explains [the mitochondrial theory of aging](http://hplusmagazine.com/2011/10/21/the-mitochondrial-theory-of-aging/) well; *“Aging is due to the cumulative effects of damage wrought by free radicals on the mitochondrial DNA and function”*. He also explains why caloric restriction works to increase lifespan by [reducing mitochondrial free radical production and mitochondrial DNA oxidative damage](http://hplusmagazine.com/2011/10/21/the-mitochondrial-theory-of-aging/), as the mitochondria are taxed less due to a lower intake of food.\n\nIf the creation of free-radicals are responsible for causing damage to our mitochondria, then can we not simply take in more antioxidants in supplement form to counteract the oxidative effect of free-radicals? Nick Lane, [author of numerous books on mitochondria](https://www.amazon.com/Nick-Lane/e/B001IXSEJ2), investigated this. His findings were that the free-radicals created by mitochondria are a stress state signal to the cell, and that taking in excess antioxidants actually cause harm by inhibiting this signal, thus interfering with apoptosis.<h4>The mitochondrial apoptosis signal can therefore be inhibited by both a low negative charge but also by excess antioxidants.</h4>{% blockquote Nick Lane http://nautil.us/issue/36/Aging/yes-life-in-the-fast-lane-kills-you Yes, Life in the Fast Lane Kills You %}\nThey (antioxidants) interfere with signaling. We now know that free radicals signal a stress state in the cell. There are all kinds of subtle distinctions, but if something is going wrong, they are behaving like a smoke detector, or at least they are the smoke, and the cell is set up to detect the smoke and react accordingly. The trouble with antioxidants is they’re in effect disabling the smoke detector, and that’s not a good thing to do. The smoke detector sets off a stress response and that stress response changes the expression of all kinds of genes, which are protective for the cell. So very often more free radicals produces a stress response which is protective, which battens down those hatches and allows a cell to go on living for longer. Messing around with that signal by throwing antioxidants at it really doesn’t help.\n{% endblockquote %}\n\nDoug Wallace, known for his extensive research on mitochondria over the past 40 years, has linked [mitochondria as the root cause for most metabolic and degenerative diseases, cancer and aging](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDDFV7Sovvs).

Cholinergic urticaria is caused by the inability to activate mast cells in the skin prior to sweat release. The symptom of this condition was a sudden, severe pain that felt like being burned alive. It was triggered by heat, stress or exercise. The affliction lasted for a few years, and the cure finally came in the form of increased sun exposure and ultraviolet light therapy at a hospital multiple times per week.\n\nI have since been on a journey to understand the reason behind why light was the cure. Doctors and dermatologists had no clue, and all initial research I did was unfruitful. I knew the cure was not vitamin D, as I had tried supplementing in various dosages without success.\n\nI now believe that the effect of sunlight on optimizing mitochondrial function, and the subsequent role of the mitochondria in immune system regulation of mast cells, is the reason that sun exposure cured my affliction with cholinergic urticaria. \n\nIt was through the work of Jack Kruse, Gerald Pollack, Doug Wallace, Nick Lane, Bill Lagakos, Travis Christofferson and many others that I finally began to understand the effects of sunlight on our mitochondria, the vital role that mitochondria have on our health, and how our circadian rhythms ensure optimal mitochondrial function. I came to understand that sunlight is a universal need and not just for myself and my genetic makeup.\n\nThis blog post is a culmination of my research. It provides the evidence for my beliefs in how light cured my affliction with cholinergic urticaria, and why I now believe that sunlight, in combination with a well-entrained circadian rhythm, is the number one determinant of our health and longevity.\n\nI welcome all comments and critique, especially from those with a scientific background who can refute or refine my understandings.","source":"_posts/sunlight-and-circadian-rhythms.md","raw":"---\ntitle: Sunlight and Circadian Rhythms - the Number One Determinant of our Health and Longevity\ndate: 2017-02-26\nbanner: \n  url: /sunlight-and-circadian-rhythms/sun.jpg\n  width: 720\n  height: 517\ntags:\n---\nIn this blog post, I present the evidence to show why exposure to sunlight, in combination with a well-entrained circadian rhythm, is the number one determining factor to our health and longevity.\n\nFirstly, I explain the mechanisms behind the photoelectric effect of sunlight. This is the ability of sunlight to penetrate the skin and induce a *negative electric charge* within the water in our cells and mitochondrial membranes.\n\nI explain what mitochondria are and what they do, and how a negative electric charge in our red blood cells and mitochondrial membranes serves to limit the cumulative damage that is caused by mitochondrial DNA mutations generated by replication errors.\n\nI explain why I believe the ability of mitochondria to regulate the immune system cured a rare disease I used to be afflicted with called cholinergic urticaria. \n\nFurthermore, I explain how melatonin's role in optimizing mitochondrial function, and I explain how a well entrained circadian rhythm through exposure to sunlight during the day and the restriction of artificial light at night ensures sufficient melatonin production.\n\nThere are other benefits that sunlight brings that are outside the scope of this blog post, such as providing the body with a means to create the [sulfated form of vitamin D](http://people.csail.mit.edu/seneff/sulfur_obesity_alzheimers_muscle_wasting.html), which cannot be obtained from a vitamin D supplement, or the ability of sunlight to [improve the cardiovascular system via the production of nitric oxide](https://www.ted.com/talks/richard_weller_could_the_sun_be_good_for_your_heart#t-704130). I hope to expand on these at a later date.\n\n## The Photoelectric Effect of Sunlight\n\nIn 1905, Albert Einstein published a paper that proposed that light acts not as a wave, but as a collection of particles, which we now call [photons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photon). This particle behavior can be observed by the photoelectric effect - the ability of light to displace electrons from a material. \n\nGerald Pollack discovered that [the photoelectric effect occurs when light is absorbed by water](https://ecee.colorado.edu/~ecen5555/SourceMaterial/Pollack13.pdf) in our cells. The chemical structure of the water changes [from H<sub>2</sub>O to H<sub>3</sub>O<sub>2</sub>](http://www.rexresearch.com/pollack/pollack.html), and this body of water [builds next to hydrophillic (water loving) surfaces](http://courses.washington.edu/bioe555/Zheng.pdf), such as those found on cell walls and [mitochondrial membranes](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15749715). Because of this change in chemical structure, the water now has a negative charge that can be utilized, similar to how a battery can store and deliver energy. Gerald Pollack coined the term *“exclusion zone”* or EZ for short, to describe the area of negatively charged water within our cells.\n\n{% blockquote Gerald Pollack, explaining how the EZ builds in mitochondrial membranes https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9UC0chfXcg Tedx Talk - Water, Cells and Life, at minute 9:17. %}\nThose (mitochondrial) membranes are hydrophillic surfaces, and as I mentioned, next to hydrophillic surfaces, EZs build, so this is a perfect configuration for buiding EZs and negative charge.\n{% endblockquote %}\n\n*This negative charge causes the mitochondrial membrane potential to increase, which  improves mitochondrial function. This is explained further in the section on mitochondria.*\n\nThe following diagram from one of Pollack's experiments shows two EZs - the control at the top and the increase in EZ after several minutes of light exposure on the bottom. \n{% img no-bottom-margin /sunlight-and-circadian-rhythms/ez-2.jpg 720 749 %} *Gerald Pollack - [The Fourth Phase Of Water](https://www.amazon.com/Fourth-Phase-Water-Beyond-Liquid/dp/096268953X/ref=mt_hardcover?_encoding=UTF8&me=). Top: control. Bottom: After several minutes of light exposure.*\n\n{% blockquote Gerald Pollack https://ecee.colorado.edu/~ecen5555/SourceMaterial/Pollack13.pdf The Fourth Phase of Water %}\nSo, the arithmetic shows not only that our body bears net negative charge, but also that the body makes every effort to maintain that negativity by ridding itself of protons. It is as though maintaining negativity is a “goal” of life. Plants do it easily: they connect directly to the negatively charged earth; animals need to struggle a bit more to maintain their body’s charge in exchange for greater mobility.\n{% endblockquote %}\n\nPollack also discovered how [the different wavelengths present in sunlight affects the EZ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2843558/). **He discovered that the infrared and ultraviolet wavelengths of light found in sunlight are the most effective at increasing the size of the exclusion zone.** As these wavelengths of light are rarely present in artificial lighting, it is important to ensure that we maximize our exposure to the sun in order to receive both infrared and ultraviolet wavelengths.\n<h2>Mitochondria and Their Utilization of Negative Charge</h2>Mitochondria are organelles that exist in large numbers within our cells. Mitochondria have their own DNA, independent of the nuclear genome within their parent cell. Their main function is to convert electrons obtained from food into ATP, the energy currency of our cells. This conversion process is called oxidative phosphorylation, and it has an oxidative effect which can damage the mitochondria DNA. Mitochondria also [signals apoptosis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4762029/) (cell death) to its parent cell, such that when it detects mitochondrial DNA damage within itself, it asks its parent cell to commit suicide. If this signaling process fails, [then faulty mitochondria can replicate and lead to cancer, other diseases and aging](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3675642/).\n\nMitochondria can also directly capture electrons directly from sunlight [through light absorbed by chlorophyll pigments](http://jcs.biologists.org/content/127/2/388). These captured electrons [increase the mitochondrial membrane potential](Light-harvesting chlorophyll pigments enable mammalian mitochondria to capture photonic energy and produce ATP), i.e. the amount of negative charge stored within the mitochondrial membrane.\n<h3>The Mitochondrial Membrane Potential</h3>This negative charge in the EZ water is used in multiple functions in the body, such as to drive blood through capillaries and to [increase the mitochondrial membrane potential](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3115691/), which optimizes mitochondrial function, such as to [ensure efficient ATP production](http://www.biotechniques.com/BiotechniquesJournal/2011/February/Mitochondrial-membrane-potential-probes-and-the-proton-gradient-a-practical-usage-guide/biotechniques-308950.html), or to ensure proper signaling to the parent cells and immune system. The lower the negative charge, the [higher the possibility that the apoptosis signal from the mitochondria will be ignored by the cell](http://www.jbc.org/content/275/10/7087.full). If the apoptosis signal is ignored, damaged cells and their mitochondria will replicate.\n\nJack Kruse calls the amount of negative charge stored within our cells the redox potential.\n{% blockquote Jack Kruse https://www.jackkruse.com/organizational-structural-failure-6-mitochondrial-rx/ The Mitochondrial Rx %}\nThe redox levels in mitochondrion are like a scale of justice.  When protons are more prominent, the redox potential is poor.  When we have more electrons in the system, the redox potential is excellent.  The more electrons we have, the more potential and kinetic energy is stored in our proteins and water hydration shell to allow us to deal with the stressors of the environment.  The human species is designed to collect electrons in excess.  Think of the redox potential as a giant sink of electrons and protons.  We need more negatively charged electrons to run our mitochondria and proteins well.  This is our redox sink or bank account.\n{% endblockquote %}<h4>The more negative charge we can obtain then, the better. More sunlight means more negative charge, which leads to better mitochondrial health and signaling.</h4><h3>The Mitochondria's Role In Regulating the Immune System</h3>[Recent research](http://www.cell.com/immunity/fulltext/S1074-7613%2815%2900077-1) has shown that mitochondria are critical to activation of the immune system response, as well as [the important role of mitochondria in mast cell activation](http://search.proquest.com/docview/861922036).\n\nOn a personal note, I suffered from cholinergic urticaria for a number of years. [Cholinergic urticaria is a disease of the immune system](http://www.webmd.com/allergies/urticaria-cholinergic), and more specifically, it is caused by the **[inability to activate mast cells in the skin prior to sweat release](http://www.cholinergicurticaria.net/).**\n\nThe symptoms of cholinergic urticaria were painful - it felt as if my body was on fire. It was triggered suddenly by any change to stress levels, heat or exercise. The cure for my condition came in the form of increased sun exposure and UVB phototherapy at a hospital multiple times per week.<h4>The effect of sunlight on optimizing mitochondrial function, and the subsequent role of the mitochondria in immune system regulation of mast cells is the reason why I believe that UVB phototherapy and sun exposure cured my condition.</h4><h3>The Mitochondrial Theory of Aging</h3>Rodney Shackelford explains [the mitochondrial theory of aging](http://hplusmagazine.com/2011/10/21/the-mitochondrial-theory-of-aging/) well; *“Aging is due to the cumulative effects of damage wrought by free radicals on the mitochondrial DNA and function”*. He also explains why caloric restriction works to increase lifespan by [reducing mitochondrial free radical production and mitochondrial DNA oxidative damage](http://hplusmagazine.com/2011/10/21/the-mitochondrial-theory-of-aging/), as the mitochondria are taxed less due to a lower intake of food.\n\nIf the creation of free-radicals are responsible for causing damage to our mitochondria, then can we not simply take in more antioxidants in supplement form to counteract the oxidative effect of free-radicals? Nick Lane, [author of numerous books on mitochondria](https://www.amazon.com/Nick-Lane/e/B001IXSEJ2), investigated this. His findings were that the free-radicals created by mitochondria are a stress state signal to the cell, and that taking in excess antioxidants actually cause harm by inhibiting this signal, thus interfering with apoptosis.<h4>The mitochondrial apoptosis signal can therefore be inhibited by both a low negative charge but also by excess antioxidants.</h4>{% blockquote Nick Lane http://nautil.us/issue/36/Aging/yes-life-in-the-fast-lane-kills-you Yes, Life in the Fast Lane Kills You %}\nThey (antioxidants) interfere with signaling. We now know that free radicals signal a stress state in the cell. There are all kinds of subtle distinctions, but if something is going wrong, they are behaving like a smoke detector, or at least they are the smoke, and the cell is set up to detect the smoke and react accordingly. The trouble with antioxidants is they’re in effect disabling the smoke detector, and that’s not a good thing to do. The smoke detector sets off a stress response and that stress response changes the expression of all kinds of genes, which are protective for the cell. So very often more free radicals produces a stress response which is protective, which battens down those hatches and allows a cell to go on living for longer. Messing around with that signal by throwing antioxidants at it really doesn’t help.\n{% endblockquote %}\n\nDoug Wallace, known for his extensive research on mitochondria over the past 40 years, has linked [mitochondria as the root cause for most metabolic and degenerative diseases, cancer and aging](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDDFV7Sovvs).

Cholinergic urticaria is caused by the inability to activate mast cells in the skin prior to sweat release. The symptom of this condition was a sudden, severe pain that felt like being burned alive. It was triggered by heat, stress or exercise. The affliction lasted for a few years, and the cure finally came in the form of increased sun exposure and ultraviolet light therapy at a hospital multiple times per week.\n\nI have since been on a journey to understand the reason behind why light was the cure. Doctors and dermatologists had no clue, and all initial research I did was unfruitful. I knew the cure was not vitamin D, as I had tried supplementing in various dosages without success.\n\nI now believe that the effect of sunlight on optimizing mitochondrial function, and the subsequent role of the mitochondria in immune system regulation of mast cells, is the reason that sun exposure cured my affliction with cholinergic urticaria. \n\nIt was through the work of Jack Kruse, Gerald Pollack, Doug Wallace, Nick Lane, Bill Lagakos, Travis Christofferson and many others that I finally began to understand the effects of sunlight on our mitochondria, the vital role that mitochondria have on our health, and how our circadian rhythms ensure optimal mitochondrial function. I came to understand that sunlight is a universal need and not just for myself and my genetic makeup.\n\nThis blog post is a culmination of my research. It provides the evidence for my beliefs in how light cured my affliction with cholinergic urticaria, and why I now believe that sunlight, in combination with a well-entrained circadian rhythm, is the number one determinant of our health and longevity.\n\nI welcome all comments and critique, especially from those with a scientific background who can refute or refine my understandings.","slug":"sunlight-and-circadian-rhythms","published":1,"updated":"2017-02-26T14:00:50.000Z","_id":"cizhq9qyo00037ygagba3zgbp","comments":1,"layout":"post","photos":[],"link":"","content":"<img src=\"/sunlight-and-circadian-rhythms/sun.jpg\"/><p>In this blog post, I present the evidence to show why exposure to sunlight, in combination with a well-entrained circadian rhythm, is the number one determining factor to our health and longevity.</p>\n<p>Firstly, I explain the mechanisms behind the photoelectric effect of sunlight.

I hope to expand on these at a later date.</p>\n<h2 id=\"The-Photoelectric-Effect-of-Sunlight\"><a href=\"#The-Photoelectric-Effect-of-Sunlight\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"The Photoelectric Effect of Sunlight\"></a>The Photoelectric Effect of Sunlight</h2><p>In 1905, Albert Einstein published a paper that proposed that light acts not as a wave, but as a collection of particles, which we now call <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photon\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">photons</a>. This particle behavior can be observed by the photoelectric effect - the ability of light to displace electrons from a material. </p>\n<p>Gerald Pollack discovered that <a href=\"https://ecee.colorado.edu/~ecen5555/SourceMaterial/Pollack13.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">the photoelectric effect occurs when light is absorbed by water</a> in our cells. The chemical structure of the water changes <a href=\"http://www.rexresearch.com/pollack/pollack.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">from H<sub>2</sub>O to H<sub>3</sub>O<sub>2</sub></a>, and this body of water <a href=\"http://courses.washington.edu/bioe555/Zheng.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">builds next to hydrophillic (water loving) surfaces</a>, such as those found on cell walls and <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15749715\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">mitochondrial membranes</a>. Because of this change in chemical structure, the water now has a negative charge that can be utilized, similar to how a battery can store and deliver energy. Gerald Pollack coined the term <em>“exclusion zone”</em> or EZ for short, to describe the area of negatively charged water within our cells.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Those (mitochondrial) membranes are hydrophillic surfaces, and as I mentioned, next to hydrophillic surfaces, EZs build, so this is a perfect configuration for buiding EZs and negative charge.</p>\n<footer><strong>Gerald Pollack, explaining how the EZ builds in mitochondrial membranes</strong><cite><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9UC0chfXcg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">Tedx Talk - Water, Cells and Life, at minute 9:17.</a></cite></footer></blockquote>\n<p><em>This negative charge causes the mitochondrial membrane potential to increase, which  improves mitochondrial function. This is explained further in the section on mitochondria.</em></p>\n<p>The following diagram from one of Pollack’s experiments shows two EZs - the control at the top and the increase in EZ after several minutes of light exposure on the bottom.<br><img src=\"/sunlight-and-circadian-rhythms/ez-2.jpg\" class=\"no-bottom-margin\" width=\"720\" height=\"749\"> <em>Gerald Pollack - <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Fourth-Phase-Water-Beyond-Liquid/dp/096268953X/ref=mt_hardcover?_encoding=UTF8&amp;me=\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">The Fourth Phase Of Water</a>. Top: control. Bottom: After several minutes of light exposure.</em></p>\n<blockquote><p>So, the arithmetic shows not only that our body bears net negative charge, but also that the body makes every effort to maintain that negativity by ridding itself of protons. It is as though maintaining negativity is a “goal” of life. Plants do it easily: they connect directly to the negatively charged earth; animals need to struggle a bit more to maintain their body’s charge in exchange for greater mobility.</p>\n<footer><strong>Gerald Pollack</strong><cite><a href=\"https://ecee.colorado.edu/~ecen5555/SourceMaterial/Pollack13.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">The Fourth Phase of Water</a></cite></footer></blockquote>\n<p>Pollack also discovered how <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2843558/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">the different wavelengths present in sunlight affects the EZ</a>. <strong>He discovered that the infrared and ultraviolet wavelengths of light found in sunlight are the most effective at increasing the size of the exclusion zone.</strong> As these wavelengths of light are rarely present in artificial lighting, it is important to ensure that we maximize our exposure to the sun in order to receive both infrared and ultraviolet wavelengths.</p>\n<p></p><h2>Mitochondria and Their Utilization of Negative Charge</h2>Mitochondria are organelles that exist in large numbers within our cells. Mitochondria have their own DNA, independent of the nuclear genome within their parent cell. Their main function is to convert electrons obtained from food into ATP, the energy currency of our cells. This conversion process is called oxidative phosphorylation, and it has an oxidative effect which can damage the mitochondria DNA. Mitochondria also <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4762029/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">signals apoptosis</a> (cell death) to its parent cell, such that when it detects mitochondrial DNA damage within itself, it asks its parent cell to commit suicide. If this signaling process fails, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3675642/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">then faulty mitochondria can replicate and lead to cancer, other diseases and aging</a>.<p></p>\n<p>Mitochondria can also directly capture electrons directly from sunlight <a href=\"http://jcs.biologists.org/content/127/2/388\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">through light absorbed by chlorophyll pigments</a>. These captured electrons <a href=\"Light-harvesting chlorophyll pigments enable mammalian mitochondria to capture photonic energy and produce ATP\">increase the mitochondrial membrane potential</a>, i.e. the amount of negative charge stored within the mitochondrial membrane.</p>\n<p></p><h3>The Mitochondrial Membrane Potential</h3>This negative charge in the EZ water is used in multiple functions in the body, such as to drive blood through capillaries and to <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3115691/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">increase the mitochondrial membrane potential</a>, which optimizes mitochondrial function, such as to <a href=\"http://www.biotechniques.com/BiotechniquesJournal/2011/February/Mitochondrial-membrane-potential-probes-and-the-proton-gradient-a-practical-usage-guide/biotechniques-308950.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">ensure efficient ATP production</a>, or to ensure proper signaling to the parent cells and immune system. The lower the negative charge, the <a href=\"http://www.jbc.org/content/275/10/7087.full\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">higher the possibility that the apoptosis signal from the mitochondria will be ignored by the cell</a>. If the apoptosis signal is ignored, damaged cells and their mitochondria will replicate.<p></p>\n<p>Jack Kruse calls the amount of negative charge stored within our cells the redox potential.<br><blockquote><p>The redox levels in mitochondrion are like a scale of justice.  When protons are more prominent, the redox potential is poor.  When we have more electrons in the system, the redox potential is excellent.  The more electrons we have, the more potential and kinetic energy is stored in our proteins and water hydration shell to allow us to deal with the stressors of the environment.  The human species is designed to collect electrons in excess.  Think of the redox potential as a giant sink of electrons and protons.  We need more negatively charged electrons to run our mitochondria and proteins well.  This is our redox sink or bank account.</p>\n<footer><strong>Jack Kruse</strong><cite><a href=\"https://www.jackkruse.com/organizational-structural-failure-6-mitochondrial-rx/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">The Mitochondrial Rx</a></cite></footer></blockquote></p><h4>The more negative charge we can obtain then, the better. More sunlight means more negative charge, which leads to better mitochondrial health and signaling.</h4><h3>The Mitochondria’s Role In Regulating the Immune System</h3><a href=\"http://www.cell.com/immunity/fulltext/S1074-7613%2815%2900077-1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">Recent research</a> has shown that mitochondria are critical to activation of the immune system response, as well as <a href=\"http://search.proquest.com/docview/861922036\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">the important role of mitochondria in mast cell activation</a>.<p></p>\n<p>On a personal note, I suffered from cholinergic urticaria for a number of years. <a href=\"http://www.webmd.com/allergies/urticaria-cholinergic\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">Cholinergic urticaria is a disease of the immune system</a>, and more specifically, it is caused by the <strong><a href=\"http://www.cholinergicurticaria.net/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">inability to activate mast cells in the skin prior to sweat release</a>.</strong></p>\n<p>The symptoms of cholinergic urticaria were painful - it felt as if my body was on fire. It was triggered suddenly by any change to stress levels, heat or exercise. The cure for my condition came in the form of increased sun exposure and UVB phototherapy at a hospital multiple times per week.</p><h4>The effect of sunlight on optimizing mitochondrial function, and the subsequent role of the mitochondria in immune system regulation of mast cells is the reason why I believe that UVB phototherapy and sun exposure cured my condition.</h4><h3>The Mitochondrial Theory of Aging</h3>Rodney Shackelford explains <a href=\"http://hplusmagazine.com/2011/10/21/the-mitochondrial-theory-of-aging/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">the mitochondrial theory of aging</a> well; <em>“Aging is due to the cumulative effects of damage wrought by free radicals on the mitochondrial DNA and function”</em>. He also explains why caloric restriction works to increase lifespan by <a href=\"http://hplusmagazine.com/2011/10/21/the-mitochondrial-theory-of-aging/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">reducing mitochondrial free radical production and mitochondrial DNA oxidative damage</a>, as the mitochondria are taxed less due to a lower intake of food.<p></p>\n<p>If the creation of free-radicals are responsible for causing damage to our mitochondria, then can we not simply take in more antioxidants in supplement form to counteract the oxidative effect of free-radicals? Nick Lane, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Nick-Lane/e/B001IXSEJ2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">author of numerous books on mitochondria</a>, investigated this. His findings were that the free-radicals created by mitochondria are a stress state signal to the cell, and that taking in excess antioxidants actually cause harm by inhibiting this signal, thus interfering with apoptosis.</p><h4>The mitochondrial apoptosis signal can therefore be inhibited by both a low negative charge but also by excess antioxidants.</h4><blockquote><p>They (antioxidants) interfere with signaling. We now know that free radicals signal a stress state in the cell. There are all kinds of subtle distinctions, but if something is going wrong, they are behaving like a smoke detector, or at least they are the smoke, and the cell is set up to detect the smoke and react accordingly. The trouble with antioxidants is they’re in effect disabling the smoke detector, and that’s not a good thing to do. The smoke detector sets off a stress response and that stress response changes the expression of all kinds of genes, which are protective for the cell. So very often more free radicals produces a stress response which is protective, which battens down those hatches and allows a cell to go on living for longer. Messing around with that signal by throwing antioxidants at it really doesn’t help.</p>\n<footer><strong>Nick Lane</strong><cite><a href=\"http://nautil.us/issue/36/Aging/yes-life-in-the-fast-lane-kills-you\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">Yes, Life in the Fast Lane Kills You</a></cite></footer></blockquote><p></p>\n<p>Doug Wallace, known for his extensive research on mitochondria over the past 40 years, has linked <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDDFV7Sovvs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">mitochondria as the root cause for most metabolic and degenerative diseases, cancer and aging</a>.

I hope to expand on these at a later date.</p>\n<h2 id=\"The-Photoelectric-Effect-of-Sunlight\"><a href=\"#The-Photoelectric-Effect-of-Sunlight\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"The Photoelectric Effect of Sunlight\"></a>The Photoelectric Effect of Sunlight</h2><p>In 1905, Albert Einstein published a paper that proposed that light acts not as a wave, but as a collection of particles, which we now call <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photon\">photons</a>. This particle behavior can be observed by the photoelectric effect - the ability of light to displace electrons from a material. </p>\n<p>Gerald Pollack discovered that <a href=\"https://ecee.colorado.edu/~ecen5555/SourceMaterial/Pollack13.pdf\">the photoelectric effect occurs when light is absorbed by water</a> in our cells. The chemical structure of the water changes <a href=\"http://www.rexresearch.com/pollack/pollack.html\">from H<sub>2</sub>O to H<sub>3</sub>O<sub>2</sub></a>, and this body of water <a href=\"http://courses.washington.edu/bioe555/Zheng.pdf\">builds next to hydrophillic (water loving) surfaces</a>, such as those found on cell walls and <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15749715\">mitochondrial membranes</a>. Because of this change in chemical structure, the water now has a negative charge that can be utilized, similar to how a battery can store and deliver energy. Gerald Pollack coined the term <em>“exclusion zone”</em> or EZ for short, to describe the area of negatively charged water within our cells.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Those (mitochondrial) membranes are hydrophillic surfaces, and as I mentioned, next to hydrophillic surfaces, EZs build, so this is a perfect configuration for buiding EZs and negative charge.</p>\n<footer><strong>Gerald Pollack, explaining how the EZ builds in mitochondrial membranes</strong><cite><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9UC0chfXcg\">Tedx Talk - Water, Cells and Life, at minute 9:17.</a></cite></footer></blockquote>\n<p><em>This negative charge causes the mitochondrial membrane potential to increase, which  improves mitochondrial function. This is explained further in the section on mitochondria.</em></p>\n<p>The following diagram from one of Pollack’s experiments shows two EZs - the control at the top and the increase in EZ after several minutes of light exposure on the bottom.<br><img src=\"/sunlight-and-circadian-rhythms/ez-2.jpg\" class=\"no-bottom-margin\" width=\"720\" height=\"749\"> <em>Gerald Pollack - <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Fourth-Phase-Water-Beyond-Liquid/dp/096268953X/ref=mt_hardcover?_encoding=UTF8&amp;me=\">The Fourth Phase Of Water</a>. Top: control. Bottom: After several minutes of light exposure.</em></p>\n<blockquote><p>So, the arithmetic shows not only that our body bears net negative charge, but also that the body makes every effort to maintain that negativity by ridding itself of protons. It is as though maintaining negativity is a “goal” of life. Plants do it easily: they connect directly to the negatively charged earth; animals need to struggle a bit more to maintain their body’s charge in exchange for greater mobility.</p>\n<footer><strong>Gerald Pollack</strong><cite><a href=\"https://ecee.colorado.edu/~ecen5555/SourceMaterial/Pollack13.pdf\">The Fourth Phase of Water</a></cite></footer></blockquote>\n<p>Pollack also discovered how <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2843558/\">the different wavelengths present in sunlight affects the EZ</a>. <strong>He discovered that the infrared and ultraviolet wavelengths of light found in sunlight are the most effective at increasing the size of the exclusion zone.</strong> As these wavelengths of light are rarely present in artificial lighting, it is important to ensure that we maximize our exposure to the sun in order to receive both infrared and ultraviolet wavelengths.</p>\n<p><h2>Mitochondria and Their Utilization of Negative Charge</h2>Mitochondria are organelles that exist in large numbers within our cells. Mitochondria have their own DNA, independent of the nuclear genome within their parent cell. Their main function is to convert electrons obtained from food into ATP, the energy currency of our cells. This conversion process is called oxidative phosphorylation, and it has an oxidative effect which can damage the mitochondria DNA. Mitochondria also <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4762029/\">signals apoptosis</a> (cell death) to its parent cell, such that when it detects mitochondrial DNA damage within itself, it asks its parent cell to commit suicide. If this signaling process fails, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3675642/\">then faulty mitochondria can replicate and lead to cancer, other diseases and aging</a>.</p>\n<p>Mitochondria can also directly capture electrons directly from sunlight <a href=\"http://jcs.biologists.org/content/127/2/388\">through light absorbed by chlorophyll pigments</a>. These captured electrons <a href=\"Light-harvesting chlorophyll pigments enable mammalian mitochondria to capture photonic energy and produce ATP\">increase the mitochondrial membrane potential</a>, i.e. the amount of negative charge stored within the mitochondrial membrane.</p>\n<p><h3>The Mitochondrial Membrane Potential</h3>This negative charge in the EZ water is used in multiple functions in the body, such as to drive blood through capillaries and to <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3115691/\">increase the mitochondrial membrane potential</a>, which optimizes mitochondrial function, such as to <a href=\"http://www.biotechniques.com/BiotechniquesJournal/2011/February/Mitochondrial-membrane-potential-probes-and-the-proton-gradient-a-practical-usage-guide/biotechniques-308950.html\">ensure efficient ATP production</a>, or to ensure proper signaling to the parent cells and immune system. The lower the negative charge, the <a href=\"http://www.jbc.org/content/275/10/7087.full\">higher the possibility that the apoptosis signal from the mitochondria will be ignored by the cell</a>. If the apoptosis signal is ignored, damaged cells and their mitochondria will replicate.</p>\n<p>Jack Kruse calls the amount of negative charge stored within our cells the redox potential.<br><blockquote><p>The redox levels in mitochondrion are like a scale of justice.  When protons are more prominent, the redox potential is poor.  When we have more electrons in the system, the redox potential is excellent.  The more electrons we have, the more potential and kinetic energy is stored in our proteins and water hydration shell to allow us to deal with the stressors of the environment.  The human species is designed to collect electrons in excess.  Think of the redox potential as a giant sink of electrons and protons.  We need more negatively charged electrons to run our mitochondria and proteins well.  This is our redox sink or bank account.</p>\n<footer><strong>Jack Kruse</strong><cite><a href=\"https://www.jackkruse.com/organizational-structural-failure-6-mitochondrial-rx/\">The Mitochondrial Rx</a></cite></footer></blockquote><h4>The more negative charge we can obtain then, the better. More sunlight means more negative charge, which leads to better mitochondrial health and signaling.</h4><h3>The Mitochondria’s Role In Regulating the Immune System</h3><a href=\"http://www.cell.com/immunity/fulltext/S1074-7613%2815%2900077-1\">Recent research</a> has shown that mitochondria are critical to activation of the immune system response, as well as <a href=\"http://search.proquest.com/docview/861922036\">the important role of mitochondria in mast cell activation</a>.</p>\n<p>On a personal note, I suffered from cholinergic urticaria for a number of years. <a href=\"http://www.webmd.com/allergies/urticaria-cholinergic\">Cholinergic urticaria is a disease of the immune system</a>, and more specifically, it is caused by the <strong><a href=\"http://www.cholinergicurticaria.net/\">inability to activate mast cells in the skin prior to sweat release</a>.</strong></p>\n<p>The symptoms of cholinergic urticaria were painful - it felt as if my body was on fire. It was triggered suddenly by any change to stress levels, heat or exercise. The cure for my condition came in the form of increased sun exposure and UVB phototherapy at a hospital multiple times per week.<h4>The effect of sunlight on optimizing mitochondrial function, and the subsequent role of the mitochondria in immune system regulation of mast cells is the reason why I believe that UVB phototherapy and sun exposure cured my condition.</h4><h3>The Mitochondrial Theory of Aging</h3>Rodney Shackelford explains <a href=\"http://hplusmagazine.com/2011/10/21/the-mitochondrial-theory-of-aging/\">the mitochondrial theory of aging</a> well; <em>“Aging is due to the cumulative effects of damage wrought by free radicals on the mitochondrial DNA and function”</em>. He also explains why caloric restriction works to increase lifespan by <a href=\"http://hplusmagazine.com/2011/10/21/the-mitochondrial-theory-of-aging/\">reducing mitochondrial free radical production and mitochondrial DNA oxidative damage</a>, as the mitochondria are taxed less due to a lower intake of food.</p>\n<p>If the creation of free-radicals are responsible for causing damage to our mitochondria, then can we not simply take in more antioxidants in supplement form to counteract the oxidative effect of free-radicals? Nick Lane, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Nick-Lane/e/B001IXSEJ2\">author of numerous books on mitochondria</a>, investigated this. His findings were that the free-radicals created by mitochondria are a stress state signal to the cell, and that taking in excess antioxidants actually cause harm by inhibiting this signal, thus interfering with apoptosis.<h4>The mitochondrial apoptosis signal can therefore be inhibited by both a low negative charge but also by excess antioxidants.</h4><blockquote><p>They (antioxidants) interfere with signaling. We now know that free radicals signal a stress state in the cell. There are all kinds of subtle distinctions, but if something is going wrong, they are behaving like a smoke detector, or at least they are the smoke, and the cell is set up to detect the smoke and react accordingly. The trouble with antioxidants is they’re in effect disabling the smoke detector, and that’s not a good thing to do. The smoke detector sets off a stress response and that stress response changes the expression of all kinds of genes, which are protective for the cell. So very often more free radicals produces a stress response which is protective, which battens down those hatches and allows a cell to go on living for longer. Messing around with that signal by throwing antioxidants at it really doesn’t help.</p>\n<footer><strong>Nick Lane</strong><cite><a href=\"http://nautil.us/issue/36/Aging/yes-life-in-the-fast-lane-kills-you\">Yes, Life in the Fast Lane Kills You</a></cite></footer></blockquote></p>\n<p>Doug Wallace, known for his extensive research on mitochondria over the past 40 years, has linked <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDDFV7Sovvs\">mitochondria as the root cause for most metabolic and degenerative diseases, cancer and aging</a>. He observed in his research that very small reductions in energy in our mitochondria causes massive implications in the epigenetic expression of our nuclear genes.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“Subtle changes in mitochondrial bioenergetics is causing phase shifts in the epi genome expression of the nuclear genes, and it’s this epi genome expression that we believe creates these phenotypic changes that are related to cancer, metabolic syndrome, to diabetes and so on.</p>\n<footer><strong>Doug Wallace</strong><cite><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDDFV7Sovvs\">A Mitochondrial Etiology of Metabolic and Degenerative Diseases, Cancer and Aging</a></cite></footer></blockquote>\n<p>Furthermore, there is increasing evidence that mitochondrial dysfunction is the root cause of cancer.

This book puts together the evidence that cancer is not a genetic disease but instead is due to mitochondrial dysfunction.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Mitochondria are so important to the fidelity of an organism that a predominant theory is called ‘the mitochondrial theory of aging.’ It contends that the condition of the mitochondria dictate the capacity of the cell to function over time.

The blue light causes ROS in your tissue, and this stress needs to be balanced with near-infrared that is not present in LEDs.

So tissue regeneration and tissue repair results from the wavelengths that are not present in an LED spectrum. </p>\n<p>We have increased stress on the short wavelength part and we have reduced regeneration and repair on the long wavelength part.

It provides the evidence for my beliefs in how light cured my affliction with cholinergic urticaria, and why I now believe that sunlight, in combination with a well-entrained circadian rhythm, is the number one determinant of our health and longevity.</p>\n<p>I welcome all comments and critique, especially from those with a scientific background who can refute or refine my understandings.</p>\n"}],"PostAsset":[{"_id":"source/_posts/sunlight-and-circadian-rhythms/sun.jpg","slug":"sun.jpg","post":"cizhq9qyo00037ygagba3zgbp","modified":0,"renderable":0},{"_id":"source/_posts/circadian-rhythm-entrainment-using-light-food-and-exercise/drsatchinpandaslide.jpg","slug":"drsatchinpandaslide.jpg","post":"cizhq9qyh00017ygakqrnk8xy","modified":0,"renderable":0},{"_id":"source/_posts/circadian-rhythm-entrainment-using-light-food-and-exercise/mexico.jpg","slug":"mexico.jpg","post":"cizhq9qyh00017ygakqrnk8xy","modified":0,"renderable":0},{"_id":"source/_posts/achieving-and-maintaining-race-weight/adelle-davis.jpg","slug":"adelle-davis.jpg","post":"cizhq9qya00007ygawodmgh14","modified":0,"renderable":0},{"_id":"source/_posts/achieving-and-maintaining-race-weight/cortisol.jpg","slug":"cortisol.jpg","post":"cizhq9qya00007ygawodmgh14","modified":0,"renderable":0},{"_id":"source/_posts/achieving-and-maintaining-race-weight/plan.png","slug":"plan.png","post":"cizhq9qya00007ygawodmgh14","modified":0,"renderable":0},{"_id":"source/_posts/achieving-and-maintaining-race-weight/raceweight-diagram.jpg","slug":"raceweight-diagram.jpg","post":"cizhq9qya00007ygawodmgh14","modified":0,"renderable":0},{"_id":"source/_posts/achieving-and-maintaining-race-weight/saturated-fat-testosterone.jpg","slug":"saturated-fat-testosterone.jpg","post":"cizhq9qya00007ygawodmgh14","modified":0,"renderable":0},{"_id":"source/_posts/achieving-and-maintaining-race-weight/the-wall.jpg","slug":"the-wall.jpg","post":"cizhq9qya00007ygawodmgh14","modified":0,"renderable":0},{"_id":"source/_posts/achieving-and-maintaining-race-weight/weighing-food.jpg","slug":"weighing-food.jpg","post":"cizhq9qya00007ygawodmgh14","modified":0,"renderable":0},{"_id":"source/_posts/sunlight-and-circadian-rhythms/ez-2.jpg","slug":"ez-2.jpg","post":"cizhq9qyo00037ygagba3zgbp","modified":0,"renderable":0},{"_id":"source/_posts/sunlight-and-circadian-rhythms/blue-light.png","slug":"blue-light.png","post":"cizhq9qyo00037ygagba3zgbp","modified":0,"renderable":0},{"_id":"source/_posts/sunlight-and-circadian-rhythms/lighting.png","slug":"lighting.png","post":"cizhq9qyo00037ygagba3zgbp","modified":0,"renderable":0},{"_id":"source/_posts/sunlight-and-circadian-rhythms/sun-vs-bulbs.jpeg","slug":"sun-vs-bulbs.jpeg","post":"cizhq9qyo00037ygagba3zgbp","modified":0,"renderable":0}],"PostCategory":[],"PostTag":[{"post_id":"cizhq9qya00007ygawodmgh14","tag_id":"cizhq9qyk00027ygabyjxw8ap","_id":"cizhq9qyw00097ygabzfkmq6q"},{"post_id":"cizhq9qya00007ygawodmgh14","tag_id":"cizhq9qyr00047ygakdkvxgdg","_id":"cizhq9qyw000a7ygavxrgbqst"},{"post_id":"cizhq9qya00007ygawodmgh14","tag_id":"cizhq9qyt00057ygaclorat48","_id":"cizhq9qyx000c7ygauy1az5ng"},{"post_id":"cizhq9qya00007ygawodmgh14","tag_id":"cizhq9qyu00067ygatswlloqi","_id":"cizhq9qyx000d7ygapgh9ngsv"},{"post_id":"cizhq9qya00007ygawodmgh14","tag_id":"cizhq9qyu00077ygaifsjejch","_id":"cizhq9qyy000f7yganv2b5d6g"},{"post_id":"cizhq9qyh00017ygakqrnk8xy","tag_id":"cizhq9qyu00087yga31bn6y4f","_id":"cizhq9qyz000j7yga7bchd5x3"},{"post_id":"cizhq9qyh00017ygakqrnk8xy","tag_id":"cizhq9qyk00027ygabyjxw8ap","_id":"cizhq9qyz000k7yga2n9ma58l"},{"post_id":"cizhq9qyh00017ygakqrnk8xy","tag_id":"cizhq9qyt00057ygaclorat48","_id":"cizhq9qyz000l7ygainbroam8"},{"post_id":"cizhq9qyh00017ygakqrnk8xy","tag_id":"cizhq9qyy000g7ygabiirvsds","_id":"cizhq9qyz000m7ygay2qffjba"},{"post_id":"cizhq9qyh00017ygakqrnk8xy","tag_id":"cizhq9qyy000h7ygaeohsfmth","_id":"cizhq9qyz000n7ygap7umnldw"},{"post_id":"cizhq9qyh00017ygakqrnk8xy","tag_id":"cizhq9qyz000i7ygaevdimyxu","_id":"cizhq9qyz000o7yga3f1c73xm"}],"Tag":[{"name":"intermittent fasting","_id":"cizhq9qyk00027ygabyjxw8ap"},{"name":"calorie restriction","_id":"cizhq9qyr00047ygakdkvxgdg"},{"name":"food","_id":"cizhq9qyt00057ygaclorat48"},{"name":"race weight","_id":"cizhq9qyu00067ygatswlloqi"},{"name":"training","_id":"cizhq9qyu00077ygaifsjejch"},{"name":"circadian rhythm","_id":"cizhq9qyu00087yga31bn6y4f"},{"name":"light","_id":"cizhq9qyy000g7ygabiirvsds"},{"name":"exercise","_id":"cizhq9qyy000h7ygaeohsfmth"},{"name":"sleep","_id":"cizhq9qyz000i7ygaevdimyxu"}]}}
