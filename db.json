Photo credit: [Primal Wear, Inc](https://www.primalwear.com/).*\n\n## Moving to Colorado\n\nI moved to Colorado with my wife Kate after living in England for 28 years. The choice was driven by a desire to live in a sunnier climate, to have a short commute time, to ride my bike in the mountains and to start racing. \n\n## Personal and Family Health\n\nMy outlook on health was forever changed upon two events in my life. When I was 19, my father died from colon cancer and watching him deteriorate in his final years was hard to take in. A few years later, I became afflicted with *cholinergic urticaria* - a horrible disease that made my whole body feel as if it was on fire. It was triggered by slight changes in temperature or by stress. I lived with this disease for a number of years, seeing doctors and dermatologists. Finally, a treatment worked. It was UVB phototherapy that gradually cured my condition, and I believe an increase in outdoor exercise through cycling helped also. I'm pleased to say I'm now free of this condition. **The painful memories have etched in me a mentality to never experience anything like this again.** \n\n\n","source":"about/index.md","raw":"---\ntitle: About Me\n---\n\nI'm Michael Lam.

Every day Kate and I woke up at sunrise and had a large breakfast. We then went to the beach for the day, skipping lunch in favor of more beach time, having an early dinner and an early night’s sleep.</p>\n<p>The photo above of us on a beach at sunset on our vacation is an example of circadian entrainment using light. <em><a href=\"http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2015/04/colors-help-set-body-s-internal-clock\">The specific composition of the wavelengths of light present at sunset are a strong signal to our circadian clocks that evening is coming</a></em>.</p>\n<p>I slept much better than I had been lately while in Mexico. Was this just due to the better circadian entrainment via increased sunlight exposure? <strong>Or perhaps I have been making a mistake by training before sunrise, skipping breakfast and eating after sunset?</strong></p>\n<h2 id=\"Sleep-better-be-healthier-and-leaner\"><a href=\"#Sleep-better-be-healthier-and-leaner\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Sleep better, be healthier and leaner?\"></a>Sleep better, be healthier and leaner?</h2><p>I’ve been <a href=\"http://bradpilon.com/introduction-to-intermittent-fasting/\">intermittent fasting</a> for the past 7-8 months. This has been mostly in the form of skipping breakfast and eating between 12pm and 8pm, although I have experimented with much shorter time windows and multi-day fasting also. </p>\n<p>During this time I felt good on the bike, my recovery time was fast and I achieved my best race results.  I would like to keep reaping the <a href=\"http://www.marksdailyapple.com/health-benefits-of-intermittent-fasting/\">benefits of intermittent fasting</a>, but <strong>optimize this further by coordinating the timing of my fed and fasted states to be in sync with my circadian rhythm</strong>. I believe this will help me sleep better, be healthier and improve my lean body mass.</p>\n<p>I used to think that circadian rhythms were set by light exposure only. Looking deeper, it appears both the timing of food and exercise play a role also. I have been careful to do my best in the past few months to entrain my circadian rhythm via maximizing sunlight and minimizing artificial light in the evening, but until now I have not considered that there is potentially a best time of day to eat or exercise in accordance with my circadian biology.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Research\"><a href=\"#Research\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Research\"></a>Research</h2><p>There are a couple of scientists doing active research and blogging about circadian rhythms: <a href=\"http://caloriesproper.com/about-me/\">Bill Lagakos</a> and <a href=\"http://www.salk.edu/scientist/satchidananda-panda/\">Professor Satchin Panda</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Optimal-Circadian-Timing-of-Food\"><a href=\"#Optimal-Circadian-Timing-of-Food\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Optimal Circadian Timing of Food\"></a>Optimal Circadian Timing of Food</h3><p>Bill Lagakos presents a very strong, evidence based case for me.</p>\n<blockquote><p>FOOD is excellent at entraining peripheral circadian clocks: if you restrict animals to one meal per day, their peripheral circadian clocks rapidly become entrained to this, regardless of when the meal is administered.</p>\n<footer><strong>Bill Lagakos</strong><cite><a href=\"http://caloriesproper.com/meal-timing-and-peripheral-circadian-clocks/\">Meal Timing and Peripheral Circadian Clocks</a></cite></footer></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>Starting the central pacemarker with bright light in the morning but skimping on the peripheral pacemaker by skipping breakfast represents a circadian mismatch: Afternoon Diabetes?
