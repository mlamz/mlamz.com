## Breakfasts and beach sunsets

I've recently come back from a lovely vacation in Mexico. It was one where I slept better than I have done for a long time. Every day Kate and I woke up at sunrise, had a large breakfast, went to the beach for the day, skipped lunch and had an early dinner and an early night's sleep.

The photo above of us on a beach at sunset is an example of circadian entrainment using light. The specific wavelengths of light at sunset are a strong signal to our circadian clocks that evening is coming.

I slept better than I have done in Mexico, and this made me think, have I been making a mistake in skipping breakfast while intermittent fasting?


## Sleep better, be healthier and leaner?

I've been [intermittent fasting](http://bradpilon.com/introduction-to-intermittent-fasting/) for the past 7-8 months. During this time I felt good on the bike, my recovery time was fast and I achieved my best race results.  I want to keep reaping the [benefits of intermittent fasting](http://www.marksdailyapple.com/health-benefits-of-intermittent-fasting/), but *optimize this further by coordinating the timing of my fed and fasted states to be in sync with my circadian rhythm*. I believe this will help me sleep better, be healthier and improve my lean body mass.

My sleep has been somewhat erratic over the winter, and I haven't been feeling as strong in my training or in my day to day energy levels. I believe the main reason is that my early morning training sessions before sunrise and my large dinners after sunset are disrupting my circadian rhythm and are therefore not conducive to alertness during the day or to good sleep at night.

I used to think that circadian rhythms were set by light exposure only. Looking deeper, it appears both the timing of food and exercise play a role also. I have been careful to do my best in the past few months to entrain my circadian rhythm via maximizing sunlight and minimizing artificial light in the evening, but I have not considered that there is potentially a best time of day to eat or exercise in accordance with my circadian biology.

## Research

There are a couple of scientists doing active research and blogging about circadian rhythms, namely Bill Lagakos and Dr. Satchin Panda, although mostly in the timing of food intake and not exercise. 

### Optimal Circadian Timing of Food

Bill Lagakos presents a very strong, evidence based case for me.

{% blockquote Bill Lagakos http://caloriesproper.com/meal-timing-and-peripheral-circadian-clocks/ Meal Timing and Peripheral Circadian Clocks %}
FOOD is excellent at entraining peripheral circadian clocks: if you restrict animals to one meal per day, their peripheral circadian clocks rapidly become entrained to this, regardless of when the meal is administered.
{% endblockquote %}

{% blockquote Bill Lagakos http://caloriesproper.com/entraining-central-and-peripheral-circadian-rhythms/ Entraining Central and Peripheral Circadian Rhythms %}
Starting the central pacemarker with bright light in the morning but skimping on the peripheral pacemaker by skipping breakfast represents a circadian mismatch: Afternoon Diabetes? Central and peripheral circadian rhythms work together.  Bright light and breakfast in the morning.
{% endblockquote %}

Dr. Satchin Panda's [research](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=29&v=qPpAvvPG0nc) showed that mice who had their food intake restricted to an 8 hour window during their optimal circadian feeding time of day not only had much better biomarkers for metabolic health but they also had more lean body mass and improved endurance.

#### The takeaways

* Eat a large breakfast at the onset of daylight, have a late lunch and skip dinner.
* Only eat during daylight hours.

### Optimal Circadian Timing of Exercise

The studies suggest that moderate intensity is fine at any time during daylight hours, and that more strenous exercise should optimally be done in the afternoon or early evening. This is the [best blog post](http://bayesianbodybuilding.com/best-time-to-work-out/) I have found on the issue which references multiple studies, with another [study here](http://journals.lww.com/nsca-jscr/Citation/2017/01000/Effect_of_Time_of_Day_on_Biochemical_Markers_in.30.aspx). It is unfortunate that access to the latter is not free, but it is discussed in the following podcast by Ben Greenfield on [The Best Time Of Day To Exercise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvIT49L8Oo4&t=1444s). The study claims that: 

* Exercise causes circadian phase shifting as much as bright light
* Hard exercise early in the morning causes sleep restriction and sleep disturbances later that evening
* The best time of day to do exercise between 2pm and 6pm.
* Finish exercise 3-4 hours prior to bed time.

#### The takeaways

* Exercise during daylight hours, outdoors if possible.
* Zone 2 is fine at any time during daylight hours.
* Leave intervals and hard group rides to the afternoon or early evening.

## My plan of action

So here's a comparison of the old and new eating plans for me:

**Old:** Skip breakfast, medium size lunch, large dinner.
**New:** Large breakfast, medium to large lunch, optional afternoon snack or pre-workout, skip dinner.


Here's a comparison of my new exercise plan going forward during weekdays.

**Old:** Training session before sunrise and breakfast. Wait until lunch for first bite of food.
**New:** Training session after work, preferably outside if it is light. Have optional pre-workout protein.

How about getting that all important protein for recovery? I'd rather keep the feeding window to a shorter time window and skip the post workout. It appears there is a new research study, [Pre- versus post-exercise protein intake has similar effects on muscular adaptations](https://peerj.com/articles/2825.pdf) that claims that a pre-workout is just as effective as a post workout.
