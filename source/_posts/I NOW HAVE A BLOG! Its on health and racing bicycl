I NOW HAVE A BLOG! Its on health and racing bicycles. My first blog post is Circadian Rhythm Entrainment using Light, Food and Exercise. I look at the optimal times of the day to eat and exercise according to our circadian biology, and the lifestyle changes I am making to accomodate these findings.

I would love to hear your comments. Please do have a read and let me know what you think.
