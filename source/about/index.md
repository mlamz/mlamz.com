I'm Michael Lam. I'm a Cat 3 cyclist living in Colorado with a keen interest in health.

*This blog isn't about drugs, supplements or quick fixes.* It's about making lifestyle changes based upon our biology and psychology to improve health and athletic performance.

## Racing Bicycles

My first season of road racing was in 2014. I spent most of my first season getting dropped, but I managed a few decent results towards the end of the season.

I managed my first podium in 2015. I lost the Salida Crit by a fraction. I'm the guy in the coral jersey.

**This irked me no end even though I was fortunate to podium at all**, given that the leading two crashed in the final corner. 

I made lifestyle changes. I worked on my mental game. I joined [Primal-Audi Denver](http://hartracing.org/). I focused and trained hard. In 2016, I won the Salida Crit this time around. I also won five other races, numerous podiums and the overall [BRAC Road Cup](https://www.coloradocycling.org/bar/menu) in Cat 4. What I've achieved is a drop in the ocean for some, yet I'm exceedingly proud of fulfilling and exceeding my goals.

I'm not sure if I will ever be able to return to the shape that I was in 2016, but I will always do my best to get both results for myself and my teammates. That's part of the beauty of road racing for me - it's a team sport where you can contribute regardless if you are on form.

## Moving to Colorado

I moved to Colorado with my wife Kate after living in England for 28 years. The choice was driven by a desire to live in a sunnier climate, to have a short commute time, to ride my bike in the mountains and to start racing. 

## Personal and Family Health

My outlook on health was forever changed upon two events in my life. When I was 19, my father died from colon cancer and watching him deteriorate in his final years was hard to take in. A few years later, I became afflicted with *cholinergic urticaria* - a horrible disease that made my whole body feel as if it was on fire. It was triggered by slight changes in temperature or by stress. I lived with this disease for a number of years, seeing doctors and dermatologists. Finally, a treatment worked. It was UVB phototherapy that gradually cured my condition, and I believe an increase in outdoor exercise through cycling helped also. I'm pleased to say I'm now free of this condition. **The painful memories have etched in me a hardened mentality to never experience anything like this again.**
